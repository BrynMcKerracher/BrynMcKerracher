- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrynMcKerracher!

- 👀 I work in Unity/C#, Arduino, C/C++, and CUDA. I'm interested in Language Hacking, Virtual Machines, Micro-Controllers, and Linear Algebra, and I'm currently trying to break into the GameDev industry here in New Zealand with a colony-sim! Check it out on itch.io at <a href="https://brynmckerracher.itch.io/trail">brynmckerracher.itch.io/trail</a>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about AI scheduling systems in order to improve the AI of my colony-sim project, Trail. You can play it for free at <a href="https://brynmckerracher.itch.io/trail">brynmckerracher.itch.io/trail</a>
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on technologies for Arduino - I'm designing a hand-held console for the ATMega1280 at [github.com/BrynMcKerracher/ByteBAC](https://github.com/BrynMcKerracher/ByteBAC).
